<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<br>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><b>sous vide</b></dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you <em>submerge the food</em> (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <u>Cooking for Geeks</u>, Jeff Potter describes it as <i>ultra-low-temperature poaching</i>.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2024-11-30">November 30.</time></p>
